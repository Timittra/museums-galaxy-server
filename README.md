# Museum's Galaxy server side

## About server:
I have used this side for react app to connect with _mongodb atlas database_. In the _server_ side I have used **node.js**. And I have implemented few **CRUD** operations like **Create, Read and Update**. I have also make **.env** for hiding credentials of database user name, password and database name. By **cors** I have connected it with client side. For this project I have created **four collections** for data saving and other utilizations. Finally for hiding .env and node_modules I have implemented **.gitignore** file. This server side is deployed in the **heroku** then connected with client side. 

### Features
* Client side has it's own features including client folder
* node.js
* CRUD
* .env
* .gitignore
* mongodb atlas 
* heroku
